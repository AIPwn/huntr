VULNHUNTR VULNERABILITY REPORT
Generated: 2025-04-02 20:52:29
================================================================================

FILE: gradio_demo.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The script does not directly expose any of the specified vulnerability types (LFI, RCE, SSRF, etc.) in its current form. However, the use of command line arguments and environment variables without strict validation could potentially lead to security issues if the script is part of a larger, more complex application where these inputs are used insecurely elsewhere. The script itself does not perform any risky operations like file operations, database queries, or network requests that could be exploited for the vulnerabilities listed. The external tools and models (OpenDeepSearchTool, LiteLLMModel) are initialized with the provided arguments, but without their implementation details, it's not possible to assess their security implications.

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 2/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- OpenDeepSearchTool: To assess if the tool's initialization with user-provided model_name and reranker could lead to vulnerabilities like RCE or SSRF.
  search_tool = OpenDeepSearchTool(model_name=args.model_name, reranker=args.reranker)
- LiteLLMModel: To evaluate if the model's initialization with user-provided model_id could introduce vulnerabilities.
  model = LiteLLMModel(model_id=args.orchestrator_model, temperature=0.2,)
- CodeAgent: To understand how the agent uses the provided tools and if it could be a vector for vulnerabilities.
  agent = CodeAgent(tools=[search_tool], model=model)
- GradioUI: To assess if the UI's launch could expose any vulnerabilities, especially if it handles user input insecurely.
  GradioUI(agent).launch()

================================================================================

FILE: evals/autograde_df.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The script does not directly expose traditional web application vulnerabilities such as LFI, RCE, SSRF, etc., as it is a standalone script for data processing. However, potential security concerns could arise from the handling of the input JSON file (`df_path`), which is read and then overwritten. If an attacker could control or influence the content of this file, they might manipulate the data processing or the output. Additionally, the use of external libraries (`litellm`) for language model interactions could introduce risks if the library has vulnerabilities or if the API calls are not securely handled. The script does not sanitize or validate the input data, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input contains maliciously crafted content.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- AFW
- UNKNOWN

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 3/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- grade_row: Processes individual rows for grading, involving external API calls which could be a vector for exploitation if the input is malicious.
  output = litellm.completion(model="openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": input_prompt}], temperature=0.0)['choices'][0]['message']['content']
- autograde_df: Manages the reading and writing of the DataFrame file, which could be exploited for arbitrary file write if the file path is controllable.
  df.to_json(df_path, orient='records', lines=True)

================================================================================

FILE: evals/eval_tasks.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The script does not directly expose vulnerabilities like LFI, RCE, or SSRF in the provided code segments. However, the use of external tools and models (OpenDeepSearchTool, PythonInterpreterTool) and the handling of file paths and user inputs could introduce risks if not properly sanitized or controlled. The script lacks explicit input validation or sanitization for file paths and model IDs, which could be exploited if the application accepts untrusted inputs. The parallel processing and file operations are managed with locks and checks, reducing the risk of race conditions or file overwrites.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- UNKNOWN

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 5/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- load_eval_dataset: Handles loading of evaluation datasets from CSV files, which could be a vector for LFI if file paths are not properly sanitized.
  df = pd.read_csv(task_path)
- append_answer: Writes answers to a JSONL file, which could be exploited for AFO if the file path is controllable by an attacker.
  with APPEND_ANSWER_LOCK, open(jsonl_file, "a", encoding="utf-8") as fp:
- answer_single_question: Processes questions using different agent types, including tool-calling agents that might execute code or make external requests, posing potential RCE or SSRF risks.
  agent = ToolCallingAgent(tools=[OpenDeepSearchTool(model_name=search_model_id or model.model_id), PythonInterpreterTool()], model=model, additional_authorized_imports=["numpy"], max_steps=15,)

ANALYSIS:
The code does not exhibit any of the specified vulnerability types (LFI, RCE, SSRF, AFO, SQLI, XSS, IDOR, CMDI, AFD, AFW, AFR, PATH, CSRF, XXE, DESERIALIZATION, BROKEN_AUTH, INFO_LEAK, INSECURE_CONFIG, OPEN_REDIRECT, UNKNOWN) as it is a static template without dynamic code execution, user input handling, or interaction with external systems.

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
Not applicable

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 10/10

================================================================================

FILE: evals/eval_gpt_web.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The script does not contain direct vulnerabilities like LFI, RCE, SSRF, etc., as it does not handle user input in a way that could be exploited for these purposes. However, there are indirect risks: 1) The script reads from and writes to files specified by command-line arguments, which could potentially be manipulated if an attacker has control over the input data or the environment where the script runs. 2) The script uses environment variables for sensitive data (OPENAI_API_KEY), which is a good practice, but the security depends on how the environment is configured. 3) The script does not sanitize input data from the CSV file, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the data is malformed or malicious, but this is unlikely to lead to remote exploitation.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- INFO_LEAK
- INSECURE_CONFIG

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
Not applicable as no direct vulnerabilities were identified that could be exploited with a proof of concept.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 3/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:

================================================================================

FILE: evals/gpt_web_extract.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The script does not directly expose vulnerabilities like LFI, RCE, SSRF, or others listed, as it primarily deals with data processing and does not interact with user inputs in a way that could be exploited for such vulnerabilities. However, the use of external libraries (litellm, pandas) and file operations (reading JSON, writing CSV) could potentially introduce risks if these components are not securely implemented or if the input files are maliciously crafted. The script does not sanitize input data, which could lead to issues if the input JSON contains malicious content. The multiprocessing aspect could lead to race conditions or other concurrency issues if the script is modified or used in a different context.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- UNKNOWN

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 3/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- litellm.completion: To understand how the script interacts with the litellm library for generating answers, which could be a vector for RCE if the library is vulnerable.

- processed_df.to_csv: To examine how the script writes output files, which could be a vector for file-based vulnerabilities if not handled securely.
  processed_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/ods_tool.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code snippet provided does not directly expose any vulnerabilities due to the lack of implementation details for critical components such as `OpenDeepSearchAgent` and how user input is processed within `ask_sync`. However, the potential for SSRF exists if the `OpenDeepSearchAgent` makes HTTP requests based on user-provided queries without proper validation or sanitization. Additionally, if the `ask_sync` method or underlying mechanisms execute commands or include files based on user input, there could be risks of RCE or LFI. Without further context on these components, it's challenging to confirm the presence of vulnerabilities.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- SSRF
- RCE
- LFI

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 3/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- OpenDeepSearchAgent: Understanding how `OpenDeepSearchAgent` processes the query and performs the search is crucial for identifying potential SSRF or RCE vulnerabilities.
  self.search_tool = OpenDeepSearchAgent(self.search_model_name, reranker=self.reranker)
- ask_sync: The implementation details of `ask_sync` are necessary to determine if user input can lead to command execution or file inclusion vulnerabilities.
  answer = self.search_tool.ask_sync(query, max_sources=2, pro_mode=True)

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/__init__.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
Final analysis cannot be completed due to insufficient code context. The current snippet does not contain any executable code that processes user input or interacts with the system, making it impossible to identify vulnerabilities.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- UNKNOWN

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 0/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- OpenDeepSearchAgent: To analyze for vulnerabilities, the implementation details of this class are needed to understand how it processes input and interacts with the system.
  from .ods_agent import OpenDeepSearchAgent
- OpenDeepSearchTool: Similar to OpenDeepSearchAgent, the implementation details are required to assess for potential vulnerabilities in how it handles data and operations.
  from .ods_tool import OpenDeepSearchTool

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/prompts.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code does not directly exhibit vulnerabilities such as LFI, RCE, SSRF, AFO, SQLI, XSS, IDOR, CMDI, AFD, AFW, AFR, PATH, CSRF, XXE, DESERIALIZATION, BROKEN_AUTH, INFO_LEAK, INSECURE_CONFIG, OPEN_REDIRECT, or UNKNOWN based on the provided content. The prompts are static and do not process dynamic input that could lead to exploitation. However, the actual implementation of the tools or agents referenced in the prompts could introduce vulnerabilities if not properly secured. Without seeing the implementation of these tools or agents, it's not possible to assess their security.

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
Not applicable as no exploitable vulnerabilities were identified in the provided code.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 2/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- PromptTemplates: To understand how prompts are structured and if any dynamic content could be injected.
  from smolagents import PromptTemplates
- SEARCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT: To analyze the static prompt for any potential injection points or insecure practices.
  SEARCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an AI-powered search agent that takes in a user’s search query, retrieves relevant search results, and provides an accurate and concise answer based on the provided context.
- REACT_PROMPT: To examine the dynamic task-solving mechanism and tool call examples for vulnerabilities.

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/ods_agent.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code primarily interacts with external APIs (SerperAPI for web search and LiteLLM for model completions) and processes their responses. The main potential vulnerabilities identified are:
1. SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): The 'serp_search.get_sources(query)' call could be vulnerable if the 'query' parameter is manipulated to make requests to internal services. However, without seeing the implementation of SerperAPI, this is speculative.
2. RCE (Remote Code Execution): The use of 'completion' from LiteLLM with dynamically constructed messages could pose a risk if the 'query' or 'context' includes malicious payloads that the LLM interprets in an unsafe manner. This is contingent on the LLM's handling of such inputs.
3. INFO_LEAK (Information Leakage): If the 'serper_api_key' or other sensitive configurations are not properly secured, they could be exposed, leading to information leakage.

Other specified vulnerabilities like LFI, SQLI, XSS, etc., are not directly applicable based on the provided code snippet, as there are no file operations, database queries, or direct HTML rendering observed.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- SSRF
- RCE
- INFO_LEAK

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
Not applicable due to the speculative nature of the identified vulnerabilities and lack of direct exploitation paths in the provided code.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 5/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- SerperAPI.get_sources: To assess SSRF vulnerability, understanding how the query parameter is used in web requests is crucial.
  sources = self.serp_search.get_sources(query)
- completion: To evaluate RCE potential, details on how the LLM processes the constructed messages are needed.
  response = completion(model=self.model, messages=messages, temperature=self.temperature, top_p=self.top_p)

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/wolfram_tool.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code is relatively secure as it primarily interacts with the Wolfram Alpha API and does not expose direct vulnerabilities like LFI, RCE, SSRF, etc. However, the API key (app_id) is passed directly to the Wolfram Alpha client, which could be a concern if not handled securely outside this code snippet. The query input is passed directly to the Wolfram Alpha API without sanitization, but since it's processed by a trusted external service, the risk of injection is mitigated. The error handling could potentially leak sensitive information if exceptions contain details about the internal system, but the current implementation only returns a generic error message.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- INFO_LEAK

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 8/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- WolframAlphaTool.forward: This method processes the user input (query) and interacts with the Wolfram Alpha API. It's crucial for understanding how input is handled and whether it's sanitized before processing.
  res = self.wolfram_client.query(query)
- WolframAlphaTool.__init__: Initializes the tool with an API key (app_id). Understanding how this key is managed is essential for assessing potential security risks.
  self.app_id = app_id

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/ranking_models/base_reranker.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code appears to be a well-defined abstract base class for semantic search functionalities, with no direct exposure to common web vulnerabilities. The methods primarily handle text processing and mathematical operations on embeddings, without interacting with external systems or unsafe input handling that could lead to vulnerabilities like LFI, RCE, SSRF, etc. The normalization parameter in methods is validated against a set of known values, preventing injection attacks. However, the actual security would depend on the implementation of the `_get_embeddings` method in subclasses, which is not provided here. Without seeing how user inputs are processed in a real-world scenario or how the embeddings are retrieved, it's difficult to assess the complete security posture.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- UNKNOWN

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 3/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- _get_embeddings: This abstract method's implementation could introduce vulnerabilities depending on how it processes the input texts and retrieves embeddings. Without seeing the implementation, we cannot assess potential risks.
  def _get_embeddings(self, texts: List[str]) -> torch.Tensor:

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/ranking_models/chunker.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code is focused on text processing and does not exhibit vulnerabilities related to LFI, RCE, SSRF, AFO, SQLI, XSS, IDOR, CMDI, AFD, AFW, AFR, PATH, CSRF, XXE, DESERIALIZATION, BROKEN_AUTH, INFO_LEAK, INSECURE_CONFIG, OPEN_REDIRECT, or any other common web application vulnerabilities. The operations are confined to in-memory text manipulation without external interactions that could be exploited.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- UNKNOWN

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
Not applicable due to the absence of vulnerabilities.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 10/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: To understand the underlying mechanism of text splitting and ensure it doesn't introduce any vulnerabilities.
  from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- split_text: To analyze how text is processed and ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced during the splitting process.
  def split_text(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
- split_texts: To analyze batch processing of texts and ensure consistent security with single text processing.
  def split_texts(self, texts: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/ranking_models/jina_reranker.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code does not directly expose vulnerabilities like LFI, RCE, SSRF, etc., as it primarily deals with making authenticated API calls to a external service (Jina AI) and processing the returned data. However, the handling of the API key in environment variables could potentially lead to information leakage if the application's environment is not securely configured. The use of the 'requests' library to make HTTP requests is standard and does not introduce SSRF vulnerabilities unless the API URL is dynamically constructed from user input, which it is not in this case. The code does not interact with the filesystem, databases, or user input in a way that would introduce common web vulnerabilities.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- INFO_LEAK

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
Not applicable as no exploitable vulnerabilities were identified in the provided code.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 8/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- JinaReranker.__init__: Initializes the API key and sets up the HTTP request headers. Critical for understanding how authentication is handled.
  self.headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
- JinaReranker._get_embeddings: Makes the HTTP request to Jina AI's API and processes the response. Important for analyzing potential SSRF or info leak vulnerabilities.
  response = requests.post(self.api_url, headers=self.headers, json=data)

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/ranking_models/infinity_rerank.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The `InfinitySemanticSearcher` class is potentially vulnerable to SSRF due to the lack of validation on the `embedding_endpoint` URL. If an attacker can control this URL, they could force the server to make requests to internal services. The risk of RCE is lower and depends on the Infinity Embedding API's handling of the input texts. Without further context on the API's security measures, these vulnerabilities remain potential rather than confirmed.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- SSRF
- RCE

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
To exploit SSRF, an attacker could initialize the `InfinitySemanticSearcher` with a malicious `embedding_endpoint` pointing to an internal service:

```python
reranker = InfinitySemanticSearcher(embedding_endpoint="http://internal-service.local")
results = reranker._get_embeddings(["test"])
```

This would cause the server to make a request to `http://internal-service.local`, potentially exposing internal services.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 6/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- _get_embeddings: This method sends a POST request to the `embedding_endpoint` with user-controlled input, which is critical for identifying SSRF and RCE vulnerabilities.
  response = requests.post(self.embedding_endpoint, json={"model": self.model_name, "input": formatted_texts})

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/context_building/process_sources_pro.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code does not directly expose high-risk vulnerabilities like RCE, LFI, or SQLI as it stands. However, the use of WebScraper to fetch HTML contents from URLs provided in the sources list could lead to SSRF if these URLs are not properly validated or sanitized. Additionally, the lack of explicit error handling beyond printing errors could lead to information leakage (INFO_LEAK) if exceptions reveal sensitive information. The code's security largely depends on the implementation of the WebScraper and the semantic_searcher classes, which are not fully provided here.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- SSRF
- INFO_LEAK

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 5/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- WebScraper.scrape_many: To analyze for SSRF vulnerabilities, understanding how URLs are fetched and processed is crucial.
  raw_contents = await self.scraper.scrape_many(links)
- InfinitySemanticSearcher.get_reranked_documents: To ensure no sensitive information is leaked during the reranking process.
  reranked_content = self.semantic_searcher.get_reranked_documents(query, documents, top_k=self.top_results)

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/context_building/build_context.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
After a thorough review, the script appears to be safe from the specified vulnerability types. It does not handle user input directly, nor does it perform operations that could lead to LFI, RCE, SSRF, AFO, SQLI, XSS, IDOR, CMDI, AFD, AFW, AFR, PATH, CSRF, XXE, DESERIALIZATION, BROKEN_AUTH, INFO_LEAK, INSECURE_CONFIG, OPEN_REDIRECT, or any other common security issues. The script's operations are confined to data formatting and string manipulation within a controlled environment.

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
Not applicable due to the absence of vulnerabilities.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 10/10

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/context_scraping/crawl4ai_scraper.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The script is primarily a web scraper and does not expose direct vulnerabilities like LFI, RCE, or SQLI due to its nature and the lack of direct user input handling beyond URL specifications. However, the potential for SSRF exists if the 'url' parameter can be manipulated to target internal services, especially since the script makes HTTP requests to external URLs. The 'user_query' parameter, if used in a way that reflects content back to the user without proper sanitization, could introduce XSS vulnerabilities. The script does not appear to handle file operations, reducing risks related to AFO, AFD, or AFR. The use of external libraries (Crawl4AI) introduces a dependency that, if vulnerable, could affect the script's security. No direct evidence of CMDI, PATH, CSRF, XXE, DESERIALIZATION, BROKEN_AUTH, INFO_LEAK, INSECURE_CONFIG, OPEN_REDIRECT vulnerabilities was found in the provided code.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- SSRF
- XSS

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
No proof of concept code is provided as the identified vulnerabilities (SSRF and potential XSS) would require specific environmental conditions (e.g., ability to control the 'url' or 'user_query' parameters in a way that targets internal services or injects malicious scripts) that are not demonstrated in the provided code snippet.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 6/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- WebScraper.scrape: This method handles URL scraping and could be a vector for SSRF if URLs can be manipulated to target internal services.
  async def scrape(self, url: str) -> Dict[str, ExtractionResult]:
- WebScraper.extract: This internal method performs the actual extraction and could process malicious content if the URL or its response is controlled by an attacker.

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/context_scraping/strategy_factory.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The StrategyFactory class itself does not directly expose vulnerabilities as it is a factory for creating strategy objects and does not process user input or interact with external systems in a way that would introduce LFI, RCE, SSRF, etc. The main concern would be the secure handling of the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable, but this is a configuration issue rather than a code vulnerability. The strategies created by the factory (e.g., LLMExtractionStrategy) might interact with external APIs or process sensitive data, but without seeing the implementation of these strategies, it's not possible to assess their security. Therefore, based on the provided code, no direct vulnerabilities are identified.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- INFO_LEAK
- INSECURE_CONFIG

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
N/A

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 3/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/context_scraping/basic_web_scraper.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code does not show direct vulnerabilities to LFI, RCE, SSRF, AFO, SQLI, XSS, IDOR, CMDI, AFD, AFW, AFR, PATH, CSRF, XXE, DESERIALIZATION, BROKEN_AUTH, INFO_LEAK, INSECURE_CONFIG, OPEN_REDIRECT, or UNKNOWN based on the provided snippet. The `extract` method uses the `AsyncWebCrawler` to fetch and process web content, but the actual handling of the URL and content is delegated to the `crawl4ai` library. Without seeing the implementation of `crawl4ai` or how the URL is processed, it's challenging to identify deeper vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a wrapper around the library with no obvious insecure practices in the shown snippet.

However, the use of external libraries (fasttext and wikipediaapi) could introduce vulnerabilities if those libraries have security issues. The script processes text content but does not appear to execute or include untrusted content in a way that would lead to code execution or other high-severity vulnerabilities. The cleaning functions for HTML and markdown are designed to remove potentially dangerous elements, reducing the risk of XSS or similar vulnerabilities.

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/context_scraping/fast_scraper.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The script does not directly expose traditional web application vulnerabilities like SQLI, XSS, or LFI due to its nature as a web scraper. However, it could be susceptible to SSRF if the URL input is not properly validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal services. Additionally, the use of an LLM for content processing introduces a potential risk if the LLM's output is not properly sanitized before being used in a way that could lead to RCE or CMDI. The script does not show direct evidence of these vulnerabilities, but the potential exists depending on how the LLM's output is utilized outside the shown context. The debug mode could lead to INFO_LEAK if error messages or stack traces are exposed to end users.

VULNERABILITY TYPES:
- SSRF
- RCE
- CMDI
- INFO_LEAK

  def _parse_llm_output(self, text: str) -> str:

================================================================================

FILE: src/opendeepsearch/context_scraping/extraction_result.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code is a simple data holder and printer with no direct exposure to user input or external systems. It does not contain any vulnerabilities in isolation. However, if instances of `ExtractionResult` are populated with untrusted data elsewhere in the application, there could be risks depending on how the content or error fields are used. For example, if `content` or `error` fields contain user-supplied data that is later rendered in a web context without proper escaping, it could lead to XSS. But such vulnerabilities would originate from the code that populates these fields, not from this file itself.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 10/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- ExtractionResult: To understand how extraction results are stored and potentially exposed to vulnerabilities through their content or error fields.
  class ExtractionResult:
- print_extraction_result: To analyze how extraction results are displayed, which could be a vector for XSS if the content or error fields contain malicious data.
  def print_extraction_result(result: ExtractionResult):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
The code is relatively secure with no direct vulnerabilities identified in the provided context. It properly handles API keys through environment variables, validates input (query cannot be empty), and uses the requests library safely with timeout and error handling. The main potential concern is the reliance on external API (Serper) which could introduce SSRF if the API URL is maliciously controlled, but the code does not allow dynamic modification of the API URL. The code does not exhibit vulnerabilities like LFI, RCE, SSRF, AFO, SQLI, XSS, IDOR, CMDI, AFD, AFW, AFR, PATH, CSRF, XXE, DESERIALIZATION, BROKEN_AUTH, INFO_LEAK, INSECURE_CONFIG, OPEN_REDIRECT, or UNKNOWN based on the provided code.

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
Not applicable as no vulnerabilities were identified that could be exploited with a proof of concept.

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 8/10

RELEVANT CODE CONTEXT:
- SerperConfig.from_env: To verify how the API key is loaded from environment variables and ensure it's not exposed or mishandled.
  api_key = os.getenv("SERPER_API_KEY")
- SerperAPI.get_sources: To analyze the construction of the HTTP request and handling of user inputs to identify potential injection or SSRF vulnerabilities.
  response = requests.post(self.config.api_url, headers=self.headers, json=payload, timeout=self.config.timeout)
